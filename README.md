Firebase Hosting:

Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.
Firebase Hosting is production-grade web content hosting for developers. With a single command, you can quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content to a global CDN (content delivery network). You can also pair Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to build and host microservices on Firebase.

Using the Firebase CLI, you deploy files from local directories on your computer to your Hosting server. Beyond serving static content, you can use Cloud Functions for Firebase or Cloud Run to serve dynamic content and host microservices on your sites. All content is served over an SSL connection from the closest edge server on our global CDN.
